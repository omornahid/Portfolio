      Hi there! I am Omor Faruk Nahid. A fresh graduate in Computer Science and
      Engineering from United International University. I love to work with
      front-end technologies. Currently I'm learning VueJS as it's one of the
      most popular front-end frameworks in the world. I want to contribute as
      much as I can with my knowledge and abilities in this sector, and I am
      hoping to pursue a successful career and progress here. Other than that, I
      love to watch movies and series.

      To sum it up, I'm working with modern technologies like:

      <code>
        <ul class="text-gradient my-4 w-fit">
          <li>Vue.js (v3)</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>HTML & CSS</li>
          <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
          <li>Git & Github</li>
        </ul>
      </code>

      Also I can work a bit with:

      <code>
        <ul class="text-gradient my-4 w-fit">
          <li>Python & MySQL</li>
        </ul>
      </code>
    </p>
